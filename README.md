### Hi there, I am Muhammad Faizan and I want to thank you for viewing my profile! 👋

🔭 Results-driven DevOps Engineer with hands-on expertise in automating, securing, and optimizing cloud infrastructure for modern, scalable applications. I specialize in designing resilient AWS environments, implementing Infrastructure as Code, and building CI/CD pipelines that accelerate software delivery while ensuring operational excellence.

At GoSaaS Inc., I've led the migration of legacy systems to modern, containerized environments using Kubernetes (EKS, LKE, OKE), Terraform, and automated CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, and ArgoCD GitOps workflows. Recognized for building production-ready cloud solutions and implementing cloud security controls aligned with industry best practices.

Key Highlights:
✔️ AWS Services: EC2, EKS, RDS, Lambda, VPC, S3, CloudWatch, OpenSearch, DocumentDB
✔️ Kubernetes & Docker for scalable microservices
✔️ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation, AWS CDK
✔️ CI/CD Automation: Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, ArgoCD GitOps
✔️ Cloud Security: IAM, CIS Benchmarks, AWS Security Hub
✔️ Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch

I’m passionate about solving complex infrastructure challenges, streamlining deployment processes, and enabling fast, secure, and reliable software releases. My technical expertise, combined with a problem-solving mindset, allows me to bridge the gap between development and operations effectively.

AWS Certified Solutions Architect, with additional certifications in Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure, I’m committed to continuously advancing my cloud and DevSecOps skills to drive innovation.

Open to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, recruiters, and teams focused on cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and automation innovation.Results-driven DevOps Engineer with hands-on expertise in automating, securing, and optimizing cloud infrastructure for modern, scalable applications.
